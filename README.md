*Radioactive* is a thrilling puzzle-adventure game set in an abandoned radioactive lighthouse. You take on the role of a lone traveler who has been shipwrecked on the island.
Looking for a means of escape, you must climb to the top of the lighthouse to send a signal to nearby travelers and get off the island. The only tool you have is a flashlight.

Upon entering the lighthouse, the flashlight carried by the player is corrupted by the radiation, and turns into the “Light Beam”, able to burn away objects it lights up. The technology is additionally able to augment the player’s flashlight to include the Dark
Beam, which negates the effects of radioactive emission, and a Mirror Beam, which reflects radioactive light off it. You must use these abilities to navigate safely through the lighthouses many twists and turns and escape the island.
